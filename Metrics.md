# Exported metrics

Many metrics are only added to the export list when their respective value first changes - you will not see train stats
before you have placed your first train. This resets after each server restart, so if no trains have moved since the
restart, no statistics for them will show up either.

Please read the warning regarding the cardinality of train metrics!

### Trains

Important! Several train metrics have a very high cardinality. This means that you will very likely get many metrics,
which can slow down your server during metric collection (see `Settings>Scheduler timer` to collect less often) and if
you do not host your own metric backend (prometheus in our default case), can cost you a lot of money if unchecked! All
train stats can be disabled in the settings to prevent this.

Histogram bucket sizes can also be adjusted in the settings.
